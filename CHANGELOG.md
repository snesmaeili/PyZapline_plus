## Version History

- **v1.0.0**: Initial professional release with full feature set
- **v0.x.x**: Development versions (not publicly released)

## Migration Guide

### From Original pyZapline_plus

If you were using the original development version:

```python
# Old way
from pyZapline_plus.pyzaplineplus import PyZaplinePlus, zapline_plus

# New way  
from pyzaplineplus import PyZaplinePlus, zapline_plus
```

The API remains largely the same, but with improved:
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Type safety
- Performance
- Testing coverage

## Breaking Changes

- Package name changed from `pyZapline_plus` to `pyzaplineplus`
- Module imports simplified
- Some internal function signatures improved for consistency
